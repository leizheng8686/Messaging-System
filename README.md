Authors: Shengkai Yu,Yunlin Zeng,Lei Zheng


We are trying to design a Messaging System, which has one server and several clients.

We can send and receive messages between one server and one client.

And we also can send and receive messages between one client and other one client through the server.

The message sent from the client can be displayed on the server.

And the client request the server to send broadcast to users, which means that all clients will receive a broadcast from the server.

We try to implement instant communication between two clients, namely two client can have a dialogue at moment.

The client can upload files to the server, and other clients also can download these files from the server.

We are going to design Graphical User Interface for both client and server.
